                        <p>Teachers, doctors and nurses will have a mandatory duty to report suspected cases of female genital mutilation under planned new measures announced by the government.</p>

                        <p>The move, designed to aid police investigations and increase the rate of prosecutions for FGM, was welcomed by campaigners against FGM.</p>

                        <p>The requirements will be legislated for through amendments in the serious crime bill. Measures will also be introduced to provide multi-agency statutory guidance for professionals.</p>

                        <p>Lynne Featherstone, the crimeprevention minister, who made the announcement late on Thursday, said: “We believe that introducing a mandatory duty will provide clarity for professionals and will give them the confidence to confront FGM. It will aid police investigations and increase the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted.</p>

                        <p>“It will also send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be held responsible for their actions and help prevent this appalling crime from happening.”</p>

                        <p>The announcement follows a public consultation which sought views from a range of professionals, community groups, survivors and the police. Among those welcoming the announcement was the human rights group Equality Now, which said getting evidence on where FGM exists was vital as part of the safeguarding of girls at risk.</p>

                        <p>Mary Wandia, the organisation's FGM programme manager, said: “We need to prevent FGM from happening at all and for that to happen, we need to have a clearer idea of the specifics relating to how reporting should take place and what pathways should be involved.</p>

                        <p>An octopus is filmed dragging a crab to its death in Western Australia. The octopus emerges from a rock pool in Yallingup, south of Perth, and pulls the unfortunate crustacean into the pool. While it's rare for octopuses to be filmed on land, it is not unusual for intertidal octopuses to roam between rockpools in the search for food – and this could be the first time one has been filmed hunting on land. As they breathe through gills, they cannot stay out of water for long.</p>

                        <p>It's so unfair. No one understands you. People who actually have no idea tell you what to do all the time. About anything. Everyone patronises you or exchanges knowing looks when you say something really important. No one sees you as an individual any more but just as some kind of generic blob. No one is there when you feel really lonely. No one is there when you discover something completely weird about the world. No one is there when you are too tired to pick up the remote control. No one gets quite how boring all of this is.</p>
                        <p>This is how it feels to be the parent of a teenager. Not all the time. Some of the time. I can't tell you how to do it, but I can reassure you that you are probably doing it all wrong. There are experts in adolescence, apparently. There are manuals that are fine if you accept that you just need to change the settings on teenagers until their lights flash on and off. Teenagers are bracketed with toddlers in terms of targeted user guides. This seems naff, but there is no one these days apparently not in need of some dumbed-down cognitive behavioural therapy. Strangely, I happen to believe teenagers – er, much like us grown-ups – are all different.</p>
                        <p>I am currently on my third teenager (she is 13; my older ones are in their 20s), but the real truth is that I am on my fourth. Me! I was a teenager. It is this experience more than anything that informs my parenting. For I know I was pretty much formed as a person by 14, and I haven't changed that much since. That may be a good thing or a bad thing. Your relationship to your adolescent is often hooked into the relationship you have with your own adolescence. So many irrational fears, hopes and denials come from this nowhere land.</p>
                        <p>That's why, when your child starts the journey of separating from you, you may react in all sorts of strange ways. You as a parent may feel suddenly out of control. Of yourself as well as of your child.</p>
                        <p>Many people seem anxious that what is seen as adolescent behaviour kicks in long before the teen years, at about 10. By this I mean the stereotypical way that we define this phase: wanting stuff, being sarcastic, needing to be alone sometimes, caring too much about being included or excluded from particular groups, demanding the impossible, being oversensitive, easily hurt and inexplicably angry. All while doing daft things. None of these behaviours belongs to any one age group, but we tend to see teenagers' emotional lives as somehow always excessive and exaggerated.</p>

                        <p class="caption"> Monaco supporters celebrate as they watch their courageous team defy the odds and beat Arsenal 3-1. Photograph: Craig Mercer/ Craig Mercer/ActionPlus/Corbis</p>
                        <p>Much has been written about Arsenal's failings and we can be fairly certain there's plenty more opprobrium in the pipeline, so let's use this platform to salute the courage, strength and indefatigability of their conquerers Monaco, who arrived at the Emirates missing five first team regulars, including their suspended captain Jérémy Toulalan. Disciplined, composed, assured, defensively solid, clinical and incredibly well organised, the visitors were everything Arsenal were not and in Fabinho had the game's standout player. Patrolling the space in front of his back four, the 21-year-old Brazilian provided a passable imitation of the wrecking ball Arsenal fans have been pleading with their manager to bring on board in a bid to bolster a brittle defence whose myriad shortcomings were once again highlighted last night. Not bad for a player who is by trade a right-back.</p>
                        <p>Leonardo Jardim's team arrived at the Emirates with a reputation for being pedestrian and dull, but proved anything but as they clinically eviscerated their hosts with the speed and precision of skilled serial killers, diligently biding their time in the first half before instilling foreboding and then outright horror either side of the interval en route to a thoroughly deserved 3-1 win. “Arsenal have excellent individuals, but this is a team sport and we were able to render them harmless,” mused Jardim afterwards. “We were very organised, but also able to attack with quality. Nobody thought this was possible, and we did it. But the task in the second leg still remains. We've won nothing yet, we just took an advantage. Football is also art - you have to know how to attack, how to defend. My team is very balanced.”</p>
                        <p>By contrast, Arsène Wenger's team is about as well-balanced as Madonna being yanked down a staircase mid-performance at the Brit Awards and while the manager was understandably withering in his post-match assessment of his players' efforts, he must ship much of the blame for needlessly abandoning his normal caution by fielding a gung-ho starting XI that suggested he was hoping to put the tie beyond Monaco with a leg to spare. He now has no choice but to take the game to the Ligue 1 side at the Stade Louis II, but history suggests the damage already done is irreparable.</p>
