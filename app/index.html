                        <p>Teachers, doctors and nurses will have a mandatory duty to report suspected cases of female genital mutilation under planned new measures announced by the government.</p>

                        <p>The move, designed to aid police investigations and increase the rate of prosecutions for FGM, was welcomed by campaigners against FGM.</p>

                        <p>The requirements will be legislated for through amendments in the serious crime bill. Measures will also be introduced to provide multi-agency statutory guidance for professionals.</p>

                        <p>Lynne Featherstone, the crimeprevention minister, who made the announcement late on Thursday, said: “We believe that introducing a mandatory duty will provide clarity for professionals and will give them the confidence to confront FGM. It will aid police investigations and increase the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted.</p>

                        <p>“It will also send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be held responsible for their actions and help prevent this appalling crime from happening.”</p>

                        <p>The announcement follows a public consultation which sought views from a range of professionals, community groups, survivors and the police. Among those welcoming the announcement was the human rights group Equality Now, which said getting evidence on where FGM exists was vital as part of the safeguarding of girls at risk.</p>

                        <p>Mary Wandia, the organisation’s FGM programme manager, said: “We need to prevent FGM from happening at all and for that to happen, we need to have a clearer idea of the specifics relating to how reporting should take place and what pathways should be involved.</p>
